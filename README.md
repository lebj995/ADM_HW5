# Repository Structure

1. **`main.ipynb`**: Jupiter Notebook that contains all the solutions for the homework questions, including the corresponding code and detailed explanations in Markdown format. It serves as the central document for understanding the logic and implementation of the project.

2. **`functions`**: A folder containing three separate Python files, each dedicated to the implementation of the functions for questions 2, 4, and 5. These files provide modular and reusable code for specific parts of the homework.

3. **`flight_network.html`**: An interactive HTML file that displays a map of the airports from a sample of the first 20000 rows of the dataset. This visualization helps in better understanding the geographic distribution and connectivity of the airports.**"To visualize it, you can download it locally."**
